The research project is about finding a way to identify the configuration options that may be performance-influential.
For example, in a simulator called PPSSPP, there are many configuration options to tune the performance.
The default settings may not always be good, and PPSSPP could run very slow.
And because PPSSPP has a lot of configuration options, it may not be very easy to figure out which ones to change to get better performance.
